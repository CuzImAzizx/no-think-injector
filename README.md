# Qwen3 No Think Injector

![alt text](assets/banner.png)

This is an improvised chrome extension that adds (ðŸ§  No Think) button for Open WebUI. Designed for Qwen3 models.

This button when pressed will add `/no_think` message at the top of the input.

Qwen3 models thinks by default and are [instructed](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3#:~:text=/think%20and%20/no_think%20instructions%3A%20Use%20those%20words%20in%20the%20system%20or%20user%20message%20to%20signify%20whether%20Qwen3%20should%20think.%20In%20multi%2Dturn%20conversations%2C%20the%20latest%20instruction%20is%20followed.) to bypass the thinking process when `/no_think` is present in the prompt.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CuzImAzizx/no-think-injector
```

2. **Load the extension**

Follow [these steps](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) to load the extension

3. **Go to Open WebUI**

If everything went correctly, you will see the "ðŸ§  No Think" button next to code interpreter.

## Future Work

I have plans to make this extension professional and available on the chrome store.
